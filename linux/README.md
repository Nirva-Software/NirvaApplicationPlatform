# NirvaApplicationPlatform

Init scripts:
- init.nirva: standard, default and minimal init script using System V.
- init.nirva.nvsLogs: standard

> In both those scripts, you may have to change the variables at the beginning of the script, especially NIRVA, USER, GROUP, LOG and the export of LANG to use a locale installed on your system.
